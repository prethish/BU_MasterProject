## Description

This was my Bournemouth Masters thesis that I had submitted at Bournemouth University for my final module in 2014. Traditionally  skinning is done by linear blend skinning which causes “candy wrapper” effects or loss of volume while rotating. Dual Quaternion skinning uses the same data as traditional skinning and produces an output without volume loss. This is not strictly accurate physical solution but it reduces the loss of volume in real time and easy to  integrate  into  existing  production  pipeline.  I was able to implement Dual Quaternion skinning algorithm successfully using openGl with QT.
